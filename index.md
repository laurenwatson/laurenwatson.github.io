# About

I am currently a third year PhD student in the School of Informatics at the University of Edinburgh and a member of the Laboratory for Foundations of Computer Science (LFCS). My core area of study is private machine learning, particularly Differential Privacy.

I am also interested in a range of theoretical and applied topics within machine learning, including submodular optimization, algorithmic stability, sequence-to-sequence prediction tasks and regularization.
